# React Native App for animal rescue

Forked from leartgjoni. Looks almost like what I want to do.

Going to attempt to modify this for Bonorong wildlife rescue service as a bit of a proof of concept (maybe just for my own enjoyment and learning).
This will definitely depend on if I ever get any time to do anything over the summer.
Would certainly like to make it a little more Map Centric. https://github.com/react-community/react-native-maps + https://mapstyle.withgoogle.com/

Would also like to make it focused on displaying current rescues and distance from user as opposed to a reporting tool.
Will need to make a fair amount of changes to the api server to get this working. 

The application has been developed with React Native, Expo, Redux, React Navigation.<br/>

- Expo: https://expo.io/@leartgjoni/anim-al <br/>
- REST API Repo: https://github.com/leartgjoni/animal-api
